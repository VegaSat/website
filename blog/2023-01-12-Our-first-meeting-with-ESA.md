Yesterday, 11.1.2023, we met with members of the commission from the European Space Agency and the Slovakian team, which is enrolling in the CanSat competition for the first time this year. We presented our secondary mission to the commission and admired the very interesting goals the Slovakian team have set themselves.

We, however, have also set ourselves quite a goal, commented on by ESA’s commission as “rarely successful”. Our mission is split into multiple parts, the first and main of which is to attempt a directed landing. During the mission, we will be collecting loads of data about our cansat’s speed, attitude, altitude and location, as well as the data we are collecting as part of our primary mission. Using this data, we will create an animation of the flight in Blender. We are also planning to build self-rotating antennas that track our cansat.

As for now, we're off to work on our mission.

See you in our next post!
