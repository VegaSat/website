Hello readers, it's been a while.

We thought you might want to know what we've been up to during this time and, oh boy, we've been busy.

{/* truncate */}
During March, we were jump scared by the fast-approaching deadline for the Critical design report, which was at the end of said month. So we got to work. We chose and ordered most of the required parts, brainstormed designs for our guidance system, contacted some more possible sponsors, devised test plans, and wrote it all down. We got criticized by our mentors for most of the designs but in the end, it made the report even better. We look forward to hearing what ESA says about it on Wednesday though!

But that's not all we've been up to. I've mentioned already we've been working on ways to test our work, and while most separate components can be tested in-house, the end product can not. On Thursday, April 20., we met with professor dr. Matev≈æ Dular from the Faculty of Mechanical Engineering in Ljubljana about trying out our guidance system in their wind tunnel. He was on board with the idea and also gave us some valuable insights that might improve our cansat. One of the most important ones might be using a streamer strip instead of a conventional parachute to make the cansat easier to guide and make the impact of possible winds lower, so that's another piece of the puzzle that we have to test.

So, we've been busy, but there is still a lot of work to do, so we have to get back to it! See you later!
