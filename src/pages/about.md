# About us
VegaSat is a team from Slovenia competing in European Space Agency's CanSat competition since 2020.

# Our mission

For our primary mission we are to collect data about environmental temperature and air pressure and constantly transmit it to our ground station. For our secondary mission, we have chosen to attempt a directed landing and later recreate the flight in Blender using the data we collected.

# Where are we from

We come from Slovenia, a chicken shaped country, and our team is composed of students from [Vegova high school](https://www.vegova.si).
