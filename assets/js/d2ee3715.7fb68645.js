On Thursday, April 20., we met with professor dr. Matev\u017e Dular from the Faculty of Mechanical Engineering in Ljubljana about trying out our guidance system in their wind tunnel. He was on board with the idea and also gave us some valuable insights that might improve our cansat. One of the most important ones might be using a streamer strip instead of a conventional parachute to make the cansat easier to guide and make the impact of possible winds lower, so that's another piece of the puzzle that we have to test."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:"So, we've been busy, but there is still a lot of work to do, so we have to get back to it!
