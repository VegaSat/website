The test started off quite badly, as the L293D IC controlling our motors died and we had no spares, so we had no guidance.\\n![Military officer helipg us fix our cansat](IMG_2143.jpg)\\n\\nWith that in mind, we set off to ascend to a kilometer aboard a Bell 206 helicopter of the Slovenian army. With help from two very kind soldiers, we successfully dropped the CanSat. Due to its small size, we were, unfortunately, unable to watch it descend.\\n![Team member standing with our cansat v1 the last time we saw it](IMG_2154.jpg)\\n\\nHere is where the real trouble began. Due to a malfunction in the ground station antenna, we received no data from the CanSat during its flight. But OK, it\'s a missed opportunity for a proper test, or so we thought. The bad news didn\'t end there. As we set off to recover our CanSat, we quickly realized the transmitter onboard had stopped transmitting. We had no way to find our CanSat using radios, and after three hours of sweeping the airfield, we gave up. We concluded that the antenna on the APC220 transmitter must have broken off during the harsh landing.\\n![A person driving a car on inactive runway looking for our cansat in the surrounding fields](20230621_151904.jpg)\\n\\nWe are now left without a CanSat, four days before we leave for Spain. But we will make it, we always have. This experience taught us many important lessons, which we are taking into consideration as we build CanSat #2. Our design has changed. Instead of four horizontal PCBs, which needed to be inter-connected, introducing multiple points of failure, we designed two vertical PCBs, independent of each other, thus reducing many points where our CanSat could fail. Besides getting rid of janky connections between PCBs, we also repositioned our antenna so that it takes up less space and can be additionally braced and reinforced. We also put the buzzer on a separate PCB, with its own battery. The motors now also have a switch to turn them off during testing.\\n![Messy workspace after rebuilding cansat in a day](20230622_131249.jpg)\\n\\nDespite our bad luck yesterday, we\'d like to thank both Aerodium Logatec and the Slovenian army for helping us with our tests and teaching us many important lessons."},{"id":"reports","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/reports","editUrl":"https://github.com/VegaSat/website/blog/2023-06-11-Reports/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2023-06-11-Reports/index.md","title":"Reports","description":"This post contains the 2 main documents we needed to submit to the ESA before the launch campaign.

We will position 3 transmitters to known locations in advance of the takeoff. Because they all will transmit FM signal on the same frequency only one will get correctly received. Assume that is the signal transmitted by the closest transmitter. We want to go towards the target, so we have to push our can away from the transmitter.\\n\\nSince all locations of the transmitters will be chosen in advance and will be programmed in the controller we calculate the azimuth of the trust. With the help of the onboard compass, we can determine what power each of the 3 guiding motors has to move at.\\n\\nWe devised our work into 3 parts.\\n\\n\\n\\n<details>\\n    <summary>Part 1 - Design internal circuitry for pulse generation</summary>\\n\\n    Once it was inevitable to use a transmitter, we immediately started planning our form of signal. We had 3 main ideas, either 3 distinct ASCII letters, 3 binary digits (like 1010 1010, 1100 1100, 1111 0000), or a square wave at 3 different frequencies. We decided on the latter because it\'s easy to generate even without a microcontroller (more on that note later) and has a hardware pulse counter. Hopefully, it won\'t hog the processor. The frequencies chosen were 600 Hz, 800 Hz and 1000 Hz; which is way less than a maximum of 40 MHz.\\n\\n    Since we want to have the ground transmitter done we still decided to use Arduino Nano as the signal source, but have plans to migrate to a 555-timer circuit if we end up with enough time.\\n\\n    To power everything we decided to use REV batteries with XT30 plug as we have multiple of them from another competition (https://firstglobal.si/). They output 12 V which means we can directly power the Arduino with it. With DIP switches you can select what frequency it transmits. We didn\'t yet know what we\'ll use for the radio transmitter, so we made our output signal line level (amplitude is 1 V) and we added a voltage divider to lower Arduino\'s 5 V to 1 V.\\n\\n    The circuit is accessible [here](circuit.png) and the code is [here](pcnt.h).\\n</details>\\n\\n\\n<details>\\n    <summary>Part 2 - Design antenna</summary>\\n\\n    2nd big part of the work was to design an antenna. First, we tried a dipole. It worked, tho range was an obvious problem. We decided to build something more directional. Yagi-Uda antennas are perfect for that. We build dual polarised Yagi-Uda antenna since then it\'s less important how it\'s directed.\\n\\n    We model our antenna in MMANA software since it\'s quite simple to use, has many tutorials online and for what we needed is free to use. The model can be found [here](antenna.png). The 3D emission diagram is found [here](emission.png). We will build it out of measuring tape, PVC pipe, hot glue and zip ties.\\n</details>\\n\\n<details>\\n    <summary>Part 3 - Choose the right transmitter</summary>\\n\\n    We chose SYN115 since that\'s what we already had on hand. \\n</details>"},{"id":"the-past-month","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/the-past-month","editUrl":"https://github.com/VegaSat/website/blog/2023-04-22-The-past-month.md","source":"@site/blog/2023-04-22-The-past-month.md","title":"The past month","description":"Hello readers, it\'s been a while.","date":"2023-04-22T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":false,"label":"VegaSat 2023","permalink":"/blog/tags/2023","description":"VegaSat 2023"}],"readingTime":1.355,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Lovro Govekar","page":{"permalink":"/blog/authors/lovro-govekar"},"key":"lovro-govekar"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"the-past-month","title":"The past month","authors":["lovro-govekar"],"tags":["2023"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Making of the guidance transmitter","permalink":"/blog/making-of-the-guidance-transmitter"},"nextItem":{"title":"Test of DTMF guidance system","permalink":"/blog/test-of-dtmf-guidance-system"}},"content":"Hello readers, it\'s been a while.\\n\\nWe thought you might want to know what we\'ve been up to during this time and, oh boy, we\'ve been busy.\\n\\n{/* truncate */}\\nDuring March, we were jump scared by the fast-approaching deadline for the Critical design report, which was at the end of said month. So we got to work. We chose and ordered most of the required parts, brainstormed designs for our guidance system, contacted some more possible sponsors, devised test plans, and wrote it all down. We got criticized by our mentors for most of the designs but in the end, it made the report even better. We look forward to hearing what ESA says about it on Wednesday though!\\n\\nBut that\'s not all we\'ve been up to. I\'ve mentioned already we\'ve been working on ways to test our work, and while most separate components can be tested in-house, the end product can not. On Thursday, April 20., we met with professor dr. Matev\u017e Dular from the Faculty of Mechanical Engineering in Ljubljana about trying out our guidance system in their wind tunnel. He was on board with the idea and also gave us some valuable insights that might improve our cansat. One of the most important ones might be using a streamer strip instead of a conventional parachute to make the cansat easier to guide and make the impact of possible winds lower, so that\'s another piece of the puzzle that we have to test.\\n\\nSo, we\'ve been busy, but there is still a lot of work to do, so we have to get back to it!

To understand how that would work one first needs to understand the addition of sine waves.\\n\\nIf you have multiple signals made of sine waves of multiple frequencies you can add all sinuses with the same frequency first and then add sums to get the sum of all signals. Sum of 2 sine waves with same frequency will have the lowest amplitude if amplitude of both of them is equal (it will be 0 if signals are 180\xb0 out of phase).\\n\\n![Graph](graph.gif)\\n\\n<details>\\n    <summary>Graph exlanation</summary>\\n\\n    Although the graph shows 2 waves it works similarly with 3.\\n    - The light blue line shows the output signal of station 1\\n    - The light green line shows the output signal of station 2\\n    - The blue line shows the received signal from station 1\\n    - The green line shows the received signal from station 2\\n    - The purple line shows the sum of received signals\\n    For 3 stations just imagine one graph like this for every pair.\\n</details>\\n\\nThe amplitude of the sum can be used to find the distance from centerpoint of transmitting stations to the receiver.
