Instead of four horizontal PCBs, which needed to be inter-connected, introducing multiple points of failure, we designed two vertical PCBs, independent of each other, thus reducing many points where our CanSat could fail. Besides getting rid of janky connections between PCBs, we also repositioned our antenna so that it takes up less space and can be additionally braced and reinforced. We also put the buzzer on a separate PCB, with its own battery.
